# About RichTextEditor

RichTextEditor was created by [Brian Kimathi](https://github.com/bryokim) for use in `Poetry Galore`, a web app
for writing and posting creative writings. It has now evolved into its own package that can be used in
other upcoming projects that require an editor.

## Team

Currently, the project is maintained by [Brian Kimathi](https://github.com/bryokim). You can check full
list of contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/poetry-galore/rich-text-editor/graphs/contributors).

## Other Contributors

Part of the codebase was inspired by the following developers:

- [Konstantin MÃ¼nster](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster)

    Gave great insight on how to create the `FloatingMenu` and even borrowed some code from his
    [repository](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/lexical-react-floating-menu).

   > I recommend checking his blog on [How To Build A Floating Menu With Lexical and React](https://konstantin.digital/blog/how-to-build-a-floating-menu-with-lexical-react).
